# My Personal Projects in Computer Vision

### Inspiration
Out of all the various applications of deep learning and artificial intelligence that exist today, computer vision is by far 
the most interesting to me. Many of us do not realize how incredibly accurate and sophisticated our sense of sight really is, until we
go about trying to teach a machine the have the same ability. The fact that there exist image classifiers and object detectors that are
more accurate than their human counterparts is a testament to how far we've come in the technological age. As the use cases for robust 
vision software continue to grow, I am more exited to see what tangible improvements they can bring to the human experience.


### Projects
This repository contains a few small CV projects that I have completed in my free time.

#### Live Face Swapper
This code lets the user implement live face swapping using a webcam. Using an image from the user's local directory, the program maps that
image onto the user's face in real time. The project uses several common CV programs and techniques, including a pretrained facial landmark
detector. 

#### Yawn Detector
The inspiration for this project came when one of my coworkers, during a particularly boring afternoon, asked 'How many times do you think
you yawn at your desk per day?' Instead of just going to Google like a normal person, I decided it would be fun to build a live yawn detector
that could detect when a subject is yawning based on the position of their top and bottom lip. It uses the same algorithms to determine 
facial landmarks as the Face Swapper app, but instead only focuses on those mapping to the top and bottom lip. Though my program is short,
simple and quite inaccurate by industry standards, similar programs are being used in DMS (Driver Monitoring Systems) to detect if a driver
is becoming drowsy.
